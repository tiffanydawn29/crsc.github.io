        <h4>About the company</h4>
        <p>
          After a year of hard-work, dedication, and a dream, Capital City
          Skydiving first opened its doors in July 2015. Owner, Bob Verret is a
          passionate skydiver who had a dream to share their love of skydiving
          with others. His vision was to create a fun, welcoming, and educated
          environment for new and experienced jumpers to feel comfortable in. At
          Capital City Skydiving, it is not only about the unconditional love of
          the sport, but also the environment and people. Not only did Bob work
          hard to secure the best and safest equipment, he employs some of the
          most enthusiastic, informed, and smiley staff! Bob and staff know that
          the entire skydiving process, from beginning to end is important and
          not a single detail was overlooked! It is such a fun and relaxing
          place that most of us consider it a second home! We hope you join us
          and find a passion as we did for the sport. Come meet some new
          friends! We promise you the best experience imaginable!
