    <h3>About the company</h3>
    <p>After a year of hard-work, dedication, and a dream, Capital City Skydiving first opened its doors in July 2015. Owner, Bob Verret is a passionate skydiver who had a dream to share their love of skydiving with others.
    His vision was to create a fun, welcoming, and educated environment for new and experienced jumpers to feel comfortable in. At Capital City Skydiving, it is not only about the unconditional love of the sport, but also the environment and people. Not only did Bob work hard to secure the best and safest equipment, he employs some of the most enthusiastic, informed, and smiley staff! Bob and staff know that the entire skydiving process, from beginning to end is important and not a single detail was overlooked! It is such a fun and relaxing place that most of us consider it a second home!
        
    We hope you join us and find a passion as we did for the sport. Come meet some new friends! We promise you the best experience imaginable!</p>
