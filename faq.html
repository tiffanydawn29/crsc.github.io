      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Is skydiving safe? Safety is our foremost priority! Like rock-climbing,
        mountain biking or skiing, skydiving has its own inherent risks. Risks
        are minimized with knowledge. By studying and understanding the risks
        involved, they can be dealt with in the safest possible manner. We are
        affiliated with the Canadian Sport Parachuting Association (CSPA). The
        CSPA is Canada’s main skydive regulation governing body. We are proud to
        support and adhere to their methods of licensing and training. Our
        skydiving equipment undergoes routine maintenance to also minimize any
        risks. All of our coaches and instructors are certified under the CSPA
        programs that have been developed over the last 6 decades.

          <div class="answer"></div>
          <p>
            We jump whenever the conditions permit. We require a clear view of
            the ground to jump. If the clouds are too low or the winds are too
            strong we may not be permitted to skydive. In the event of a weather
            delay, an option to reschedule will be offered at a more convenient
            time (depending on availability). Weather delays will be at the
            discretion of Campbell River Skydive Centre and may occur last
            minute. There will be no cost associated with rebooking.

            Tandem jumps typically take 30 minutes of preparation, 30 minutes of
            flight time, ~1 minute of free-fall, ~5 minutes of canopy flight,
            and a 10 minute return trip to the airport where we will prepare
            your video if you purchased that option. Be prepared for unforeseen
            delays such as weather and aviation traffic. Allow up to 3 hours for
            the total experience.<br />

            If you are Learning to skydive solo be prepared for a 5 hour First
            Jump Course typically starting at 9am on Saturday mornings.
            Following the 5 hour class, the jump itself will take 30 minutes of
            preparation, 15 minutes of flight time, and 5 minutes of freefall
            and canopy flight. Be prepared for unforeseen delays such as weather
            and aviation traffic. Allow up to 7 hours for the total experience.

          <div class="answer"></div>
          <p>
            Bring warm clothing as it can be a bit colder at altitude. However,
            on a warm, sunny day you could easily wear shorts/leggings and a
            t-shirt. We do not recommend dresses or skirts. Campbell River
            Skydive Centre will provide jumpsuits that will cover your entire
            outfit if you wish. Also please bring good running shoes or hiking
            boots to jump in – no sandals or heels and ideally no lace hooks on
            your boots. We will provide you with googles for your jump. We can
            also provide you with an optional leather frap hat if you prefer the
            ‘shot out of a cannon’ look

            You wear goggles on your skydive which we provide for you. Just let

            necessary accommodations for you.

            According to the CSPA (Canadian Sport Parachuting Association) Basic
            Safety Rules and our dropzone policy, no jumper is allowed to
            operate a camera during a skydive with less than 200 jumps
            experience. We will gladly offer video services for your jump with
            professional skydiving videographers. However, family and friends
            are more than welcome to videotape your plane loading and canopy
            landing!

          >
          <div class="answer"></div>
          <p>
            No. You leave the plane which is travelling at about 90 mph (144
            kmh) forward and you gradually transition to falling downwards. This
            transition means most people don’t get that initial falling feeling
            as you would get on say an amusement ride.
